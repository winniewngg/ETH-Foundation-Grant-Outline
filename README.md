# Project Abstract
As perceptions towards big tech and financial movements in China continue to change, 

# Objectives
Through this project, we aim to deliver high-quality analyses of historical context and case studies based in Asian countries that help enable data scientists, researchers, and all community members to better understand the limitations and opportunities that Web3 technologies face in frontiers outside of the traditional Western system. The intents of our research are:

- To provide understanding of how to encourage productive, sustainable adoption of blockchain technology within Asian countries, within divergent political, economic, and social contexts.
- To raise awareness and foster meaningful discussion within the community regarding richness of perspective when considering foreign governments and financial systems and a more inclusive approach to integrating Web3 technologies when approaching regions that differ from traditional Western financial systems.
- To synthesize the history of blockchain adoption and previous financial movements in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore and identify novel insights about how to drive meaningful crypto usage in Asian economies. 
- To discover possible misunderstandings about cryptocurrency that the ecosystem and governments should acknowledge and be educated on, to develop more knowledge-driven perceptions.

# Project Team

For this project, the following individuals will be involved:
Cindy - Second advisor to project, did research under the venture arm at Galaxy, focusing on topics such as     
Cindy grew up in Hong Kong, spending time in __. Cindy will be spending 2 hours a week advising this project.     

Erik - First advisor to the project, did crypto research at a hedge fund in New York this past summer. Currently works as a Pear VC Fellow focusing on Web3, and co-leads the FranklinDAO Research team with Cindy. Erik was born in the US, but spent 6 years of his childhood in Hong Kong, with parents who grew up in China. Erik will be spending 4 hours a week advising this project.     

All members of our team have significant ties to Eastern and Western cultures. Combined with our expertise in crypto, we feel like we have a unique background that would provide a distinct perspective on this topic. 

# Background
Penn Blockchain/FranklinDAO is the student-run Blockchain organization at the University of Pennsylvania. Our team regularly publishes research, investment theses, and governance recommendations and hosts events promoting the adoption of Web3. Many of our past & present leadership, both undergraduate and graduate students, have been inspired by their involvement in FranklinDAO to work on Web3 ventures full-time and are prominently involved in the ecosystem.   
    
Our research team is comprised of students from both the School of Engineering and Wharton School with diverse interests in Web3. This past semester, we published long-form pieces on crypto regulation, the thesis behind app chains versus rollups, undercollateralized lending, maximum extractable value, and decentralized identity. We have also become more involved with promoting our work to the mainstream public by recording podcasts and social media clips.
