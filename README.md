# Project Abstract
Our research focuses on investigating the Eastern perspective surrounding blockchain adoption. We will draw from both historical and primary sources to drive actionable insights about how crypto usage can be better tailored for Eastern political and ideological narratives. 

# Objectives
As the community continues to expand in the Western world and into markets across the globe, there is a pressing need for greater awareness regarding the differing standards and challenges that cryptocurrency adoption faces, especially given that cryptocurrency has historically been based in Western financial, political, and economic systems. 

Through this project, we aim to deliver high-quality analyses of historical context and case studies based in Asian countries that help enable data scientists, researchers, and all community members to better understand the limitations and opportunities that Web3 technologies face in frontiers outside of the traditional Western system. The intents of our research are:

- To raise awareness and foster meaningful discussion within the community regarding richness of perspective when considering foreign governments and financial systems and a more inclusive approach to integrating Web3 technologies when approaching regions that differ from traditional Western financial systems.
- To synthesize the history of blockchain adoption and previous financial movements in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore and identify novel insights about how to drive meaningful crypto usage in Asian economies. 
- To discover possible misunderstandings about cryptocurrency that the ecosystem and governments should acknowledge and be educated on, to develop more knowledge-driven perceptions.

# Outcomes
We hope that our research will help the community acknowledge the ways in which cryptocurrency adoption has been tailored to Western contexts, and reevaluate the way they approach Eastern markets and ecosystems. To address the greater community, our research will aim to:

- To provide understanding of how to encourage productive, sustainable adoption of blockchain technology within Asian countries, within divergent political, economic, and social contexts.
- To initiate community considerations about cultural and geopolitical inclusivity in future deep tech endeavors in Eastern countries. 
- To foster discussion regarding possible misconceptions within the community surrounding Eastern governance and perceptions towards blockchain technology.

# Grant Scope
We will compile sources and findings on Asian governance regarding technological and economic developments, taking into account the multiplicity of governmental powers across different regions of Asia. We will establish historical parallels of tech and financial movements to illustrate how differences in governance and values culminate in outcomes that may be unfamiliar in Western contexts, and challenge the ways in which the community has approached Eastern adoption of blockchain technology. We will focus specifically on use cases in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India:

China: China has continued to enforce the “blockchain, not bitcoin” stance since 2019, when President Xi called for accelerated blockchain adoption before banning cryptocurrency transactions in 2021 While centralized attempts to implement blockchain technology such as the central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the recently launched China Digital Assets Trading Platform have seen little traction, significant adoption of crypto exists in trading (Chinese accounts made up 8% of FTX customer base pre-collapse) and bitcoin mining (as the second largest bitcoin miner in the world) despite regulations. Our research will focus on the misalignment between government policy and citizen action, and investigate the possibility of converging centralized efforts with real blockchain usage moving forward.  

Hong Kong: As crypto-asset markets have continued to evolve following the HKMA’s January 2022 discussion paper regarding regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, Hong Kong has worked to develop a risk-based approach towards stablecoin structures for regulation under the proposed regime. They are still working to determine the pros and cons between new legislation and amending existing laws that prepares for the further integration of stablecoins within their economy. As such, their cautionary approach coupled with relative acceptance towards the adoption of cryptocurrencies within the Hong Kong economic and political landscape presents an unique and noteworthy case study that illustrates the multiplicity of perspectives towards blockchain in Asia that we would like to explore. Our research will focus on providing commentary in respect to recent notable market and regulatory developments.

Philippines: The Philippines leads in retail adoption of crypto second only to Vietnam, with a penetration of 15%. As a developing economy with consistent inflationary pressures on the peso, crypto is commonly used for remittances and payment. For the large unbanked and underbanked population in the Philippines, crypto is appreciated for its security, low transaction fees, and fast transaction times. Further, the government itself has demonstrated increasing intent in developing blockchain use cases in the country, such as initiating a pilot project on issuing CBDC in addition to implementing blockchain training programs within agencies such as the Department of Science and Technology. Our research will focus on understanding the catalysts and hurdles that will shape the Philippines' path to becoming a blockchain hub moving forward. 

Singapore: The Singaporean blockchain market has the potential to reach a range of market spending between $1.9B and $2.6B by 2030. Since 2013, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has cautioned consumers against the significant risks associated with digital transactions. Their most recent consultation period in December 2022 outlines a series of regulations that aim to protect retail customers and ensure stability in the digital payment market through cutting down on leveraged transactions and mandating base capitalization and other risk-regulating activities. The stance on cryptocurrency in Singapore is contradictory: they aim to become a cryptocurrency hub, yet have indicated hostility towards digital currencies and transactions, citing volatility and security issues. Still, they have shown their approval on blockchain technology in the past and have leveraged various projects, such as Project Ubin and Project Guardian. Out research will focus on analyzing the conditions in which Singapore has launched their recent crackdown on digital markets and working to understand what the blockchain community might look like there going forward. 

India: Since taking over the G-20 presidency, India has made regulating crypto assets a priority in the group’s agenda, with the goal of creating a global Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) accepted by all countries. In March 2022, a 30% tax on crypto profits was implemented which drove a rapid decline in trading volume from India across major cryptocurrency exchanges, from 70% within 10 days to 90% in the next three months. Crypto traders moved to offshore exchanges and projects moved outside of India. Still now, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended a complete ban on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ETH, viewing them as a threat to RBI’s authority. Our research will focus on how India’s perception of crypto has shifted in recent years, and identifying catalysts for the continuing crackdown. 

# Project Team

All members of our team have significant ties to Eastern and Western cultures. Combined with our expertise in crypto, we believe our unique backgrounds allow us to provide a distinct perspective on this topic.

# Background
Penn Blockchain/FranklinDAO is the student-run Blockchain organization at the University of Pennsylvania. Our team regularly publishes research, investment theses, and governance recommendations and hosts events promoting the adoption of Web3. Many of our past & present leadership, both undergraduate and graduate students, have been inspired by their involvement in FranklinDAO to work on Web3 ventures full-time and are prominently involved in the ecosystem.   
    
Our research team is comprised of students from both the School of Engineering and Wharton School with diverse interests in Web3. This past semester, we published long-form pieces on crypto regulation, the thesis behind app chains versus rollups, undercollateralized lending, maximum extractable value, and decentralized identity. We have also become more involved with promoting our work to the mainstream public by recording podcasts and social media clips.
