# Background
Penn Blockchain/FranklinDAO is the student-run Blockchain organization at the University of Pennsylvania. Our team regularly publishes research, investment theses, and governance recommendations and hosts events promoting the adoption of Web3. Many of our past & present leadership, both undergraduate and graduate students, have been inspired by their involvement in FranklinDAO to work on Web3 ventures full-time and are prominently involved in the ecosystem.   
    
Our research team is comprised of students from both the School of Engineering and Wharton School with diverse interests in Web3. This past semester, we published long-form pieces on crypto regulation, the thesis behind app chains versus rollups, undercollateralized lending, maximum extractable value, and decentralized identity. We have also become more involved with promoting our work to the mainstream public by recording podcasts and social media clips.
